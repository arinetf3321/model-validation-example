What does the value of the bias on the model prediction mean?
The values Mean number of atoms: 28.172 and Standard deviation of number of atoms: 8.234586571285774 indicate the average number of atoms and the variation in the number of atoms, respectively. For the molecules represented by the standardized SMILES in CSV file representing the dataset. With respect to the dataset,
***The mean number of atoms is 28.172. This means that, on average, the molecules in the dataset have approximately 28 atoms. This value provided an idea of the typical size or complexity of the molecules in the dataset.

***The standard deviation of the number of atoms is 8.235. This value indicates the spread or variation in the number of atoms among the molecules in the provided dataset. A higher standard deviation suggests that the sizes of the molecules vary more widely around the mean.

@@@Thus, the mean and standard deviation provide highlight into the average size and the variation in size of the molecules represented by the standardized SMILES in the provided dataset. These values can help to understand the characteristics of the provided dataset and identify any bias or unusual patterns in the distribution of molecular sizes.
