From the mean and standard deviation of the molecular weights of the molecules represented by the standardized SMILES. The consistency of these values across different runs or datasets provide a measure of reproducibility. According to the means and stardard deviations obtained, the model is consistet, thus reprodicuble. The analysis is extended to assessing reproducibility of the model using scatter plot as provided in the file "Assessing_model_reproducibility_with_scatterplot.ipynb". Similarly, the consistency of data points which cluster closely  together from the scatterplot conclude the model is reproducible.
